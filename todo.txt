Changes to be made to include global radiation in v10.8

To do:
PET
Rn:  net radiation at crop surface (using ECA&D elements:  sunshine dura-
tion and cloud cover)

Write similar chapter to 5.3.10 Sunshine indices

Clearness Index
Calculated as fraction of total clear sky irradiances per day

Chandler Burning Index (CBI) uses the air temperature and relative humidity to calculate a numerical index of fire danger. Several metservices use them. 

CBI = (((110 - 1.373*RH) - 0.54 * (10.20 - T)) * (124 * 10**(-0.0142*RH)))/60

where:

RH = forecast monthly mean afternoon relative humidity (percent) --> monthly afternoon
T = forecast monthly mean afternoon temperature (degrees Celsius)--> monthly afternoon

Fuel Mositure Index (FMI) is an estimate of moisture content in available fuels, it uses the air temperature and relative humidity to calculate a numerical index of fire danger. 

FMI = 10 - 0.25 (T - H) 
where H = Relative Humidity as % (0-100) and T = Temperature in Degrees Celcius.
